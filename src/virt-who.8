.SH ENVIRONMENT
virt-who also reads environmental variables. They have the same name as command line arguments but upper-cased, with underscore instead of dash and prefixed with VIRTWHO_ (e.g. VIRTWHO_ONE_SHOT). Empty variables are considered as disabled, non-empty as enabled
.SH USAGE
.SS MODE
virt-who has three modes how it can run:
.TP
1. one-shot mode
# virt-who -o

In this mode virt-who just sends list of guest UUIDs to the server and exits.
.TP
2. interval mode
# virt-who

This is default mode. virt-who will check and send list of guest UUIDs once per hour. This interval can be changed using "-i INTERVAL" option where INTERVAL is number of seconds how often it should check and send the list.
.TP
3. background mode
# virt-who -b

This mode is similar to interval mode but it monitors events from libvirt and update list of guest UUIDs as soon as possible. It also does the interval check (interval can be altered by "-i INTERVAL" option).
.IP
NOTE: virt-who don't print anything to terminal in this mode
.IP
NOTE: monitoring for events requires libvirt backend, but this mode can be used with all backends.

.SS VIRTUALIZATION BACKEND

virt-who can use couple of virtualization backends.
.TP
1. libvirt
# virt-who

# virt-who --libvirt

Use libvirt as virtualization backend. This is default.
.IP

NOTE: virt-who can monitor for events only in this mode.
.TP
2. vdsm
# virt-who --vdsm

Use vdsm as virtualization backend.
.TP
3. ESX

# virt-who --esx --esx-owner=ESX_OWNER  --esx-env=ESX_ENV --esx-server=ESX_SERVER --esx-username=ESX_USERNAME --esx-password=ESX_PASSWORD

Use ESX (vCenter) as virtualization backend and specify option required to connect to ESX server.

.TP
4. RHEV-M

# virt-who --rhevm --rhevm-owner=RHEVM_OWNER  --rhevm-env=RHEVM_ENV --rhevm-server=RHEVM_SERVER --rhevm-username=RHEVM_USERNAME --rhevm-password=RHEVM_PASSWORD

Use RHEV-M as virtualization backend and specify option required to connect to RHEV-M server.

.TP
5. Hyper-V

# virt-who --hyperv --hyperv-owner=HYPERV_OWNER  --hyperv-env=HYPERV_ENV --hyperv-server=HYPERV_SERVER --hyperv-username=HYPERV_USERNAME --hyperv-password=HYPERV_PASSWORD

Use Hyper-V as virtualization backend and specify option required to connect to Hyper-V server.

.TP
6. Fake

Fake virtualization backend fetches the host/guests association from file. This can be useful in environments where the hypervisor is not accessible by virt-who.
It's only available through configuration file, see virt-who-config(5) for details about configuration of this backend.


.SS SUBSCRIPTION MANAGER

virt-who can report host/guest associations either to Subscription Asset Manager (SAM), Satellite 6, or Satellite 5.
.TP
1. Subscription Asset Manager or Satellite 6
# virt-who

# virt-who --sam

System must be registered using subscription-manager prior to using virt-who. Configuration for connecting to SAM is shared between subscription-manager and virt-who. This is default.

.TP
2. Satellite 5
# virt-who --satellite --satellite-server=SAT_SERVER --satellite-username=SAT_USERNAME --satellite-password=SAT_PASSWORD

This option can't be used for monitoring local guests, use rhn-virtualization-host instead.

.SH LOGGING
virt-who always writes error output to file /var/log/rhsm/rhsm.log. In all modes, excluding background ("-b"), it writes same output also to the standard error output.

virt-who can be started with option "-d" in all modes and with all backends. This option will enable verbose output with more information.
